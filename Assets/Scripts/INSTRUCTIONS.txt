YOU MUST HAVE UNITY

Thank you for downloading this shitty package and I give you good luck for your game.
Most of this is by BRACKEYS, the goat so don't give credit to me.
anyways \/ \/ \/

You need a ground check, a graphics model, and a camera.
on the parent of all of this you should have a character controller. also equip the Player Movement script.

equip graphics but disable/remove the collision component

equip the MAIN CAMERA onto the character if you didn't already and put the mouse look script onto it

now create an empty gameObject and put it onto the bottom of your character

now go to the player (the parent of all this) and assign all the values, look in the script to change some things

there ya go :)
